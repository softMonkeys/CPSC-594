Introduction - Who we are

Introduction of HireGround
  -background information of the company
    -introduce what they do, why they do it
    -too time consuming for employers to process high volume of applicants
    -quickly identify qualified applicants

How it works currently
  -Talk about how they parse through resumes currently
  -based on resume sections such as work/experience
    
Talk about Objective
  -Increase accuracy of matching algorithm from 60 to 80%
  -Display output/information in a visually clear, concise, and (c)appealing format.

Constraints
  -we aren't able to have immediate access to the database, we will have to test on a smaller test sample size first.
  -we have little experience in neural networks in the group
  
Assumptions
  -assume that HireGround is taking care of user security.
  -we assume that we have access to the algorithm.
  -we assume that we do not need special accomodations for mobile platforms.
  
Team & Roles Definition
  -Considerations for 2-man team
  -Strengths
  -
  
Deliverables
  -All of the historical data will be trained to fit the new Postgres DB
  -Resume will be seperated into their sections for parsing individually.
  -Just w.e is on his todo list slide

Requirements
Functional
  -Data must be in a Postgres DB format
  -Resume sections must be seperated, extracted to raw text, then run through with the algorithm to determine matching score
  -Output needs to be displayed in a visualized format
  -
  
Non-functional
  -information visualization must be produced in a reasonable amount of time, to avoid site loading screen.
  -scalability; code needs to be well-organized
  -maintainable; after we improve on the algorithm, naturally Hireground needs to be able to improve on it further after the project.
  -needs to be able to handle large volumes of data, upwards of 300k resumes
  -able to meet the requested 80% accuracy on the matching.
